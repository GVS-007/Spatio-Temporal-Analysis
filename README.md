# Spatio-Temporal-Analysis

Abiotic Stresses such as water stresses play a crucial
role in the growth of crops. Incessant and early water stress
monitoring helps us identify the onset of crop loss. Deep
Learning (DL) combined with image processing techniques aid
us in determining Water Input Stress levels. DL architectures,
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM), are well-known for capturing spatial
and temporal attributes, respectively. In this work, we leverage
the distinguishing features of both CNNs and LSTMs to learn
spatiotemporal patterns. We present a comparative assessment
of two DL models: ConvLSTM and CNN-LSTM, which are
used for early identification of water input stress levels in
progressive sugarbeet crops. A total of Four hundred and
eighty digital images were acquired from each of the thirty
crops over sixteen timeframes biweekly to form the input
dataset for the deep-learning models. Among the two models,
the performance of ConvLSTM was found to be superior, with
an accuracy of 83.33%.
